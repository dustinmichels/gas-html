# gas-html

Work in progress.

Trying to create vs-code language extension for HTML to correctly parse Google App Script (GAS) html templates.

See:

- https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide
- https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/html/templates

## Usage

Copy and paste into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.

This will extend the definition of html files to include the GAS syntax (which is probably not what you want all the time, so you may need to delete/disable extension when not editing GAS filess...)

A better solution would be to create a new language, ghtml/gas-html. Work in progress.
